Action Cards: 34 cards that execute special functions.
Rent Cards: 13 cards used to charge opponents rent.

3. Setup
Prepare the Deck:
Remove the 4 Quick Start Rule cards (set these aside for reference).
Shuffle the remaining 110 cards thoroughly.
Deal Cards:
Deal 5 cards to each player face down.
Place the remaining cards in the center as the draw pile.
Determine the First Player:
Choose a starting player by any agreed method (often the youngest player).
4. Gameplay Structure
Each turn consists of the following phases:

A. Draw Phase
At the start of your turn, draw 2 cards from the draw pile.
Exception: If you begin your turn with 0 cards in hand, draw 5 cards instead.
B. Action Phase
Play up to 3 cards from your hand during your turn. (You are not required to play all three if you choose not to.)
Cards can be played in one (or a combination) of three ways:
Into Your Bank:
Place money cards and/or action cards (if you want them to count as money) face-up.
Cards in your bank serve as funds for paying opponents.
Into Your Property Area:
Lay property cards (or property wildcards) face-up in front of you to build property sets.
As an Action:
Play action cards (e.g., Rent, Forced Deal, Sly Deal, etc.) to execute their effects; these are placed in the center discard pile after use.
C. End of Turn
After playing, if you have more than 7 cards in your hand, discard down to 7.
Cards already on the table (in your bank or property area) remain in play.
D. Special Note on Running Out of Cards
If you run out of cards during your turn, you do not immediately draw new ones. On your next turn, if you begin with 0 cards, draw 5 instead of 2.
5. Payment Rules
When Paying: Use cards from your bank and/or property area.
Hand Cards: Cards in your hand cannot be used for payments.
Combination: You may combine cards from your table to meet the payment required.
Short Payment: If you cannot pay the full amount, pay as much as you can—no change is given.
6. Winning the Game
Victory Condition: Be the first player to display three complete property sets (each of a different color) on the table.
Complete Set: Each property card indicates how many cards are needed to complete that color set.
7. Additional Rules & Clarifications
Rearranging Cards:
You may rearrange or move your property cards (including wildcards) during your turn only.
Finality of Plays:
Once a card is played to your bank or property area, it cannot be returned to your hand.
Just Say No Interactions:
A Just Say No card cancels an opponent’s action card played against you.
It may also be used in response to another Just Say No, potentially allowing the original action to take effect if countered twice.
Turn Order:
Play continues clockwise.
